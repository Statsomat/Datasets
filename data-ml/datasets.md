1. expressionData_final.RData
Description: mRNA
expression levels in 179 prostate cancer samples. Discover possible clusters of tissue types (e.g. primary,
secondary, other, etc.). Remark: Primary tumors are those located at the site where the tumor
began to grow (i.e., where it originated). Metastatic (or Secondary) tumors
are those that have spread to other parts of body from the original
tumor site.
